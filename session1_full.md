# Session 1 - The Revelation of Christ in Leviticus: The Holy God and His Way of Access

## 1. The Central Focus of the Bible --- Christ the Fulfillment of all Scripture

The whole Bible has one magnificent centre --- the Person and Work of
Christ. From Genesis to Revelation every line moves toward Him and finds
its completion in Him.

*"You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal
life; and these are they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to
come to Me that you may have life."* (Jn 5:39, 40)

*"Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all
the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."* (Luke 24:27)

**1.1 Veil and Vision**

When Israel read the Law, a veil lay over their hearts (2 Cor.
3:14--16). They saw the words but not the Word; the form but not the
Face. But when the heart turns to Christ, the veil is taken away. Then
everything changes:

• The law becomes life.

• The shadow reveals its substance.

• The ritual unveils the Redeemer.

The same Scriptures that once concealed Him now reveal the glory of
Christ, the true and living Reality. The Spirit opens the eyes of faith
to see beyond the letter into the living Person --- *"The letter kills,
but the Spirit gives life."* (2 Cor. 3:6)

**1.2 The Structure of the Old Testament**

The Old Testament is divided into three great sections: Law, Prophets,
and Psalms (Writings). Jesus declared that everything written in the Law
of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms spoke concerning Him.

*"All things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses,
and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me."* (Lk 24:44)

**1.3 Christ and the Law**

*"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets; I did not
come to destroy but to fulfill."* (Mt 5:17--18)

The Law revealed God's holiness and demanded righteousness. Christ
fulfilled it by perfect obedience and by offering Himself as the true
sacrifice. The Law demanded; Christ delivered. The Law revealed sin;
Christ removed it. The Law showed the way; Christ became the Way.

**1.4 Christ and the Prophets**

*"The Law and the Prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom
of God is preached"* (Lk 16:16). *"To Him give all the prophets
witness"* (Acts 10:43). Every prophet pointed to Him; Christ came as
their fulfillment.

**1.5 Christ and the Psalms**

*"All things must be fulfilled ... in the Psalms concerning Me"* (Lk
24:44). The Psalms unveil His suffering (Ps 22), resurrection (Ps 16),
kingship (Ps 2), and priesthood (Ps 110). What the Law required, what
the Prophets foretold, and what the Psalms expressed---Christ fulfilled
completely.

**1.6 Christ Revealed to the Disciples**

*"Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked with us on the
road?"* (Lk 24:32). Every sacrifice, law, song, and prophecy finds
meaning only in Christ Himself.

**1.7 Apostolic Confirmation**

  **Reference**     **Witness of Fulfillment**
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Rom 3:21          *"The righteousness of God ... witnessed by the Law
                    and the Prophets."*

  Heb 10:7          *"Behold, I have come---In the volume of the book it
                    is written of Me---To do Your will, O God."*

  Acts 26:22--23    Paul preached nothing beyond what the Prophets and
                    Moses said.

  Jn 5:46           *"If you believed Moses, you would believe Me. for he
                    wrote about Me"*
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.8 Summary**

The Law shows the holiness of God. The Prophets reveal the purpose of
God. The Psalms express the heart of God. All three converge in Christ,
the fullness of God.

• In Genesis He is the Seed of the woman (3:15).

• In Exodus the Passover Lamb (12:13).

• In Leviticus our High Priest and Sacrifice.

• In Numbers the lifted Serpent (21:8--9 cf. John 3:14).

• In Deuteronomy the Prophet like Moses (18:15 cf. Acts 3:22).

**2. Christology and Revelation --- Eagle and Keyhole View**

"Christology" means the study of the Person and Work of Christ. The
Bible may be examined through a keyhole --- individual doctrines or
events --- or viewed from the eagle's height, perceiving its grand unity
in the eternal purpose of God. Without knowing Christ, one cannot truly
know God, worship Him, or be transformed by Him. The Bible does not
simply reveal facts **about** Christ --- it reveals **Christ Himself**.
God gave us the Scriptures not only to inform our minds but to
**transform our hearts**. The purpose of revelation is **relationship**.
The goal of doctrine is **devotion**. Unless we **know Him**, we cannot
be changed by Him. Unless we **see Him**, we cannot follow Him. Unless
we **abide in Him**, we cannot obey or worship Him.

*"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent"* (John 17:3). Knowledge
without communion becomes pride. Doctrine without devotion becomes
dryness. But when the truth of Christ fills the heart, it produces
worship, obedience, and holiness.

Paul said, *"That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and
the fellowship of His sufferings."* (Phil 3:10)

Every book of the Bible --- including Leviticus --- is meant to lead us
into that kind of **knowing**. When we study Leviticus, we are not just
studying ancient rituals; we are learning what it means to **draw near
to God** through the sacrifice of His Son. The revelation of Christ is
the root of all transformation. The more clearly we see Him, the more
deeply we are changed into His image.

"*We all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the
Lord, are transformed into the same image"* (2 Cor 3:18). Therefore,
when we open this book, let us not seek knowledge alone --- let us seek
**Him**. For only those who know Him can truly follow, obey, and worship
Him.

Every true revelation of God produces humility. When **Isaiah** saw the
Lord high and lifted up, he cried, *"Woe is me! for I am undone; because
I am a man of unclean lips."* (Isa 6:5)

When **Peter** saw the miraculous power of Jesus, he fell at His knees
and said, *"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."* (Luke 5:8)

When **John** saw the risen Christ in His glory, he said, *"When I saw
Him, I fell at His feet as dead."* (Rev 1:17)

The closer we come to the Light, the more we see our own unworthiness.
Yet in that very moment of brokenness, **grace lifts us up**. Isaiah was
cleansed by a live coal from the altar. Peter was called to become a
fisher of men. John was commissioned to write the Revelation. The same
Lord who humbles also restores. To **see Him** truly is to be
**changed** forever.

**3. The Four Interpretive Principles of Revelation in Leviticus**

To enter the riches of Leviticus, four interpretive keys must be held.
God revealed truth through **shadows**, **dual realities**, **divine
separation**, and **layered meaning.**

**3.1 Shadow vs Substance**

Scripture calls the Law *"a shadow of good things to come, and not the
very image of the things"* (Heb 10 : 1). In Leviticus, every sacrifice,
priest, and ritual was a shadow pointing to Christ, the Substance---the
true and living fulfillment. --- Christ.

A shadow is real but incomplete; it depends on the substance for its
form.

  ------------------------------------------
  **Shadow**            **Substance /
                        Reality**
  --------------------- --------------------
  Outline without       Complete reality
  details               

  Copy                  Original

  Temporary             Permanent

  Earthly               Heavenly

  Depends on reality    Self-existent
  ------------------------------------------

"*These are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of
Christ.*" (Col 2:17)

*"The law having a shadow of the good things to come can never make
those who approach perfect."* (Heb 10:1).

The shadow **teaches**; the substance **fulfills**.

The shadow **points**; the substance **provides**.

The shadow **shows the form**; the substance **gives the life**.

**3.2 Reality of Duality**

Two dimensions of reality run side by side --- the visible and the
invisible. The earthly tabernacle was a copy of the heavenly (Ex 25:40;
Heb 8:5). The Levitical priests served "the copy and shadow of the
heavenly things." Both were real: the visible illustrated the invisible.
Believers now live in both realms --- on earth yet seated with Christ in
heavenly places (Eph 2:6).

Shadow → Pointer → Reality (Christ)

*"But the substance is of Christ."* (Col 2:17)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

We blame the Jews for missing Christ by clinging to sacrifices; yet many
Christians miss Him by clinging to His gifts. They held the shadows and
lost the Substance; we hold the gifts and lose the Giver.

Christ is not an addition to life --- Christ is the Life (Col 3:4).
Everything God gives is a pointer; Christ is the point.

**3.3 Divine Separation → The Principle of Holiness**

From the beginning God divided --- light from darkness, land from sea,
Israel from the nations, Levites from the tribes, the high priest from
the priests. (Lev 20:26)\
Separation is the principle of holiness.

The Principle of Holiness (Summary)

**a. God's Divine Order**

Everything begins as common. From the common God divides the clean and
unclean; from the clean He chooses what is holy. Common → Clean → Holy →
God's presence.

**b. Meanings**

Common -- ordinary, not yet claimed.

Clean -- fit to approach God. Unclean -- unfit for His presence
(declared so by God's sovereignty, not by moral fault). Holy --
belonging to God, claimed and filled by Him.

**c. Purity and Sanctification**

Purity is freedom from mixture --- the inner truth of holiness (Matt
5:8). Sanctification is the Spirit's work that makes holiness a living
reality (Heb 13:12; John 17:17).

In Leviticus, sanctification was ritual and external; in Christ, it is
spiritual and internal.

**d. Fulfilment in Christ**

In the Law: the unclean defiled the clean. In Christ: the Holy touches
the unclean and makes them clean (Mark 1:41--42). Holiness now flows
outward --- not separation alone but sanctifying presence.

**e. Summary Truth**

Holiness is not merely separation from sin but participation in God's
own nature.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Begins with **sacrifice** and ends with **sanctification** --- the
journey from the Cross to Consecration.

**4.6 Key Verse and Idea**

*"Be ye holy, for I am holy."* (Lev 11 : 44; 19 : 2; 20 : 7). **Theme:**
Holiness through Atonement.

**4.7 Spiritual Message**

Redemption is not the end but the beginning (Ex 25 : 8). Leviticus shows
what kind of people can live in God's presence. *"You shall be to Me a
kingdom of priests and a holy nation."* (Ex 19 : 6). *"You are a chosen
generation, a royal priesthood"* (1 Pet 2 : 9). Leviticus reveals
**Christ as our approach, Mediator, and Holiness.**

**4.8 Key to Understanding Leviticus**

Read with spiritual eyes: the altar, priest, blood, and feasts all point
to Christ---the Lamb, the High Priest, the Sanctuary, the Presence of
God.

**4.9 Summary Reflection**

Exodus ends with glory **filling** the Tabernacle; Leviticus begins with
a voice **calling** from it. God calls not from the mountain of fear but
from the tent of fellowship. The message is not "Stay away," but **"Come
near."** The word "come near" defines access to God. Leviticus is
precisely about how a sinful people may draw near to a holy God.

The offerings (qorban) themselves come from the same root qrb, meaning
"something brought near." The priesthood's role was to mediate nearness.
The sacrifices symbolized approach through substitution and cleansing.

**(draw near, approach, bring -- 80-85 times)**

**5. God's Justice System --- The Law and the Sacrifice**

Leviticus reveals that God's justice system stands upon two unchanging
pillars: the Law and the Sacrifice.

The Law declares the standard of God's holiness. The Sacrifice provides
the solution for man's sinfulness. Without the Law, sin is unknown;
without the Sacrifice, sin is unforgiven. Together they reveal the
perfect harmony of righteousness and mercy.

**5.1 The Law --- The Holy Demand**

*"The soul that sinneth, it shall die"* (Ezek 18 : 4). *"Cursed is
everyone who does not continue in all things written in the book of the
law"* (Deut 27 : 26; Gal 3 : 10). The Law exposes sin but cannot cleanse
it; it judges but cannot justify. It reveals God's absolute holiness and
our desperate need for a Redeemer. ***"**By the law is the knowledge of
sin**"*** **(Rom 3 : 20).**

**5.2 The Sacrifice --- The Merciful Provision**

*"Without shedding of blood there is no remission"* **(Heb 9 : 22).**
Where the Law condemns, the Sacrifice intercedes. The altar becomes the
meeting place of justice and grace.

*"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed
each other"* (Ps 85 : 10). Every offering in Leviticus declares that:
The Law demands death for sin. The Sacrifice offers life through
substitution.

**5.3 The Harmony of Law and Sacrifice in Christ**

At the Cross both aspects meet perfectly.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Aspect**   **Revealed in the Law** **Fulfilled in Christ**
  ------------ ----------------------- -----------------------------------------
  Justice      The sinner must die     "Christ died for our sins." (1 Cor 15 :
               (Ezek 18 : 4)           3)

  Holiness     Requires obedience      "He became obedient unto death." (Phil 2
                                       : 8)

  Mercy        Accepts a substitute    "The Lord laid on Him the iniquity of us
                                       all." (Isa 53 : 6)

  Love         Provides a way back     "God so loved the world that He gave His
                                       Son." (Jn 3 : 16)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cross is where the Law is satisfied and the Sacrifice is fulfilled.
*"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: we establish
the law**"*** (Rom 3 : 31).

**5.4 Summary**

The Law demands holiness; the Sacrifice provides it. The Law declares
guilt; the Sacrifice removes it. The Law reveals sin; the Sacrifice
redeems the sinner. The Law says, *"The soul that sinneth shall die."*
The Sacrifice answers, *"Christ died for the ungodly."* (Rom 5 : 6)

Leviticus thus shows both the severity of divine justice and the
sweetness of divine mercy --- and both meet perfectly in Jesus
Christ**,** *"the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."* **(Rev
13 : 8)**

**7) The Continuity of Redemption --- From Eden to Calvary**

The sacrifice of Christ is not a new idea but the culmination of one
eternal plan.

In Eden, God clothed Adam and Eve with skins --- innocent life for
guilty life.

Abel offered a lamb and found acceptance (Gen 4:4).

Noah built an altar after the flood (Gen 8:20--21).

Abraham offered Isaac but received a ram in his stead (Gen 22:13).

At Passover, Israel was redeemed by the blood of the lamb (Ex 12:13).

At Sinai, blood sealed the covenant (Ex 24:8). All these anticipated
*"the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."* (Rev 13:8)

  Animal sacrifice               Perfect Lamb of God

  High priest entering yearly    Christ entered once for all (Heb 9:12)

**8) The Voice from the Tabernacle --- A Closing Reflection**

Leviticus opens not with thunder and fear but with a call of grace:
*"Now the Lord called to Moses"* (Lev 1:1). God who dwelt in
unapproachable light now invites His people to draw near through blood
and faith. It is the voice of relationship, not ritual --- a God who
wants to dwell among His own.

The book that begins with sacrifice ends with sanctification; what
begins at the altar ends in communion. So too, our salvation begins at
the Cross and finds its goal in a life wholly given to God.

*"You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"* (Ex 19:6).
*"To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood... to
Him be glory and dominion forever."* (Rev 1:5--6)

Leviticus is therefore not a book of rituals but a revelation of Christ
--- the Holy One who calls, cleanses, and communes with His people.

**Why So Many Sacrifices?**

1.  **Typological Progression** -- Each offering revealed a distinct
    truth about Christ.

2.  **Pedagogical Purpose** -- A visual gospel teaching holiness and
    substitution.

3.  **Protective Purpose** -- Prevented Israel from pagan innovation
    (Deut 12 : 30-31).

4.  **Prophetic Purpose** -- Foreshadowed the once-for-all sacrifice of
    Christ (Heb 10 : 11-12).
