**Session 9 --- Christ in Dedication, Vows, and the Presence of God
(Leviticus 27)**

**Theme:** *Holiness Expressed in Devotion --- Christ the Perfectly
Consecrated One.*

**1. Introduction: From Atonement to Dedication**

Leviticus ends not with the sacrifices, feasts, or jubilees, but with
**vows and dedications** --- the voluntary acts of consecration. Having
revealed how sinners draw near through blood, God now shows how the
redeemed respond through **devotion**.

*"Now these are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses...
concerning vows and dedicated things."* --- Leviticus 27:34

This final chapter reminds us that worship culminates not merely in
forgiveness, but in **surrender**. Atonement (chap. 16) removes the
barrier; holiness (chaps. 17--26) builds the relationship; **dedication
(chap. 27)** expresses love's response.

Christ, the true Israelite, embodies this perfectly --- *the Man wholly
vowed to God's will.*

*"Behold, I come to do Your will, O God."* --- Hebrews 10:7

Thus, Leviticus ends where the Gospel life begins --- with hearts wholly
yielded to God.

**2. The Structure of Leviticus 27**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Section**   **Topic**                                         **Verses**
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------- ------------
  I             Valuation of persons vowed to the Lord            1--8

  II            Dedication of animals                             9--13

  III           Dedication of houses                              14--15

  IV            Dedication of fields                              16--25

  V             Devoted (ḥērem) things --- irrevocable vows       26--29

  VI            The law of the tithe                              30--33

  VII           Summary                                           34
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each item --- person, animal, property --- was valued and could be
redeemed by payment of a set amount. God ends the book with a call to
**voluntary consecration** and **evaluated devotion**, because holiness
must not only be received; it must be **returned to God** in love.

  נֶדֶר        *neder*               Vow, voluntary       Lev 27:2        Christ's perfect vow
                                   promise                              (Heb 10:7)

  חֵרֶם        *ḥērem*               Devoted, set apart   Lev 27:28       Christ wholly devoted
                                   for destruction or                   (John 17:19)
                                   God's exclusive use                  

  גָּאַל        *gāʾal*               Redeem, buy back     Lev 27:13       Christ redeems what
                                                                        is vowed and lost

  מַעֲשֵׂר       *maʿăśēr*             Tithe, tenth part    Lev 27:30       Christ the first and
                                                                        the best portion (1
                                                                        Cor 15:20)

  קֹדֶשׁ        *qōdeš*               Holy, set apart      Lev 27:30       "Holy One of God"

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every key term points to Christ --- the Holy One, the Devoted One, the
Redeemer, and the Firstfruits of all consecration.

**4. The Valuation of Persons (27:1--8)**

*"When a man makes a special vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by
your valuation."* --- Leviticus 27:2

Different age groups were assigned different *valuations* in silver
shekels --- the measure of strength and service. It was not about worth
before God but about **capacity for temple work**.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Category**   **Male**       **Female**       **Symbolism**
  -------------- -------------- ---------------- --------------------------
  20--60 years   50 shekels     30 shekels       Full strength of life

  5--20 years    20 shekels     10 shekels       Youthful service

  1 month--5     5 shekels      3 shekels        Infant consecration
  years                                          

  60+ years      15 shekels     10 shekels       Mature devotion
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Spiritual Lesson:**

God values every life devoted to Him --- young or old, strong or weak
--- according to faith and availability, not ability.

*"They shall still bear fruit in old age."* --- Psalm 92:14

**Christological Fulfillment:**

Christ fulfills the vow of perfect humanity --- offering Himself
entirely to the Father's will, at every stage of life. He is the
*"servant in whom My soul delights"* (Isa 42:1).

**5. The Dedication of Animals (27:9--13)**

Clean animals vowed to God became holy and could not be exchanged or
redeemed.\
Unclean animals could be redeemed with money plus a fifth.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Symbol**       **Meaning**        **Fulfillment**
  ---------------- ------------------ -----------------------------------
  Clean animal     Acceptable life    Christ's sinless humanity
                   offered            

  Unclean animal   Fallen humanity    Christ's redemptive substitution
  redeemed         bought back        

  Adding a fifth   Grace beyond law   "Where sin abounded, grace much
                                      more abounded" (Rom 5:20)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Christ, all distinctions between clean and unclean are resolved ---
He sanctifies the unclean by His offering.

**6. The Dedication of Houses and Fields (27:14--25)**

A house dedicated to the Lord could be redeemed with its estimated value
plus one-fifth. Fields were valued by seed-yield and proximity to
Jubilee.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Type**        **Meaning**           **Spiritual Fulfillment**
  --------------- --------------------- ----------------------------------
  House           Domestic life         Family as God's dwelling (Josh
                  consecrated           24:15)

  Field           Labor and inheritance Service consecrated to the Lord (1
                                        Cor 3:9)

  Jubilee         Property returned     Final redemption of all creation
  restoration                           (Rom 8:21)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Christological Truth:**

Christ dedicated both "house" (the people of God) and "field" (the
world). He is Lord of the house and Lord of the harvest (Matt 9:38).

**7. Devoted Things --- the ḥērem (27:26--29)**

*"Nothing that a man devotes to the LORD, whether man or beast or field,
shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the
LORD."* --- Leviticus 27:28

The *ḥērem* referred to something **irreversibly set apart** --- either
for destruction (in judgment) or for God's exclusive use.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Example**             **Meaning**      **Fulfillment**
  ----------------------- ---------------- -------------------------------
  Cities devoted in       Judgment on sin  Christ bore the curse of the
  battle (Josh 6:17)                       devoted (Gal 3:13)

  Priestly gifts devoted  Holiness beyond  Christ the utterly consecrated
  to God                  recall           One
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Doctrinal Insight:**

All *ḥērem* points to the absolute claims of holiness --- nothing
devoted to God can belong to man again. Christ fulfills this as the One
who was **wholly given**, with no reservation, even unto death.

*"For their sakes I sanctify Myself."* --- John 17:19

**8. The Law of the Tithe (27:30--33)**

*"All the tithe of the land, whether seed of the land or fruit of the
tree, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD."* --- Leviticus 27:30

Tithing recognized God as owner of all things. It was not merely an
economic rule but an **act of worship** --- the giving of the first and
best.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Element**    **Meaning**           **Fulfillment**
  -------------- --------------------- -----------------------------------
  Tenth part     Acknowledgment of     "Of Him, through Him, and to Him
                 ownership             are all things" (Rom 11:36)

  Firstfruits of Gratitude for grace   "Christ the firstfruits" (1 Cor
  increase                             15:20)

  Holy to the    Consecration of       Christ the Holy One offered fully
  Lord           totality              
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Typological Insight:**

The tithe prefigures **Christ as the tithe of humanity** --- the first
and best portion given wholly to God for the redemption of all.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

**10. The Theology of Dedication**

1.  **Dedication is voluntary but sacred.**

> The vow (*neder*) was optional, but once made, it was binding. Love
> gives freely; holiness keeps faithfully.

2.  **Dedication involves valuation and redemption.**

> Whatever is offered must be measured and, if redeemed, paid for ---
> showing that consecration has a **cost**.

3.  **Dedication culminates in Christ.**

> He is the true *Nazarite of God* --- the One vowed, consecrated, and
> crowned with holiness (Num 6; John 17:19).

4.  **Dedication flows from gratitude.**

> Leviticus 27 follows all the feasts and sacrifices: only those
> redeemed and cleansed can dedicate themselves to God.

*"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present
your bodies a living sacrifice."* --- Romans 12:1

**11. The Christological Fulfillment**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Levitical Theme**   **Christ's Fulfillment**
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  Vowed persons         Christ offered Himself willingly (John 10:17--18)

  Redeemed property     Christ restores all that was lost (Luke 19:10)

  Devoted things        Christ wholly consecrated to God (John 17:19)

  Tithes and            Christ the firstborn among many brethren (Rom
  firstfruits           8:29)

  Valuation by silver   Redemption by precious blood (1 Pet 1:18--19)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, the final chapter of Leviticus is not an appendix but the **apex**
--- Atonement leads to devotion, forgiveness leads to offering, and
grace leads to gratitude.

**12. Doctrinal Synthesis**

1.  **Dedication completes redemption.**\
    Salvation received must become service returned. *"We love Him
    because He first loved us."*

2.  **Christ embodies total consecration.**\
    Every vow finds its perfection in Him --- the Man for God.

3.  **The Spirit applies this holiness to believers.**\
    Our bodies and possessions belong to God; we are His devoted
    portion.

4.  **The Church lives as a devoted people.**

> *"You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood... that you may
> declare His praises."* (1 Pet 2:9)

5.  **All ends with holiness.**

> The last word of Leviticus is *qōdeš* --- holy. The first word of sin
> was "you shall be as gods"; the final word of redemption is "be holy,
> for I am holy."

**Closing Meditation**

*"Holy to the LORD."* --- Leviticus 27:30\
*"For their sakes I sanctify Myself."* --- John 17:19

Leviticus begins with **blood on the altar** and ends with **holiness to
the Lord**. The journey from guilt to glory, from offering to devotion,
is complete in Christ.

He is the One who vowed, offered, redeemed, and devoted all to the
Father --- and in Him, we too are called *"holy unto the Lord."*

*"The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared... teaching us to
live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world."* --- Titus
2:11--12
