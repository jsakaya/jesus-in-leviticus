**Session 5 - Christ in the Laws of Cleansing and Holiness (Leviticus
11--15; 17--20)**

**Theme:** *"Be holy, for I am holy" --- Cleansing and sanctification
fulfilled in Christ.*

**1. Introduction: The God Who Separates and Sanctifies**

After the atonement of Leviticus 16, the next great section (Leviticus
11--20) unfolds the principle of **holiness** --- what it means to live
as a cleansed and separated people.\
Atonement makes access possible; holiness makes fellowship continual.

*"For I am the LORD your God: you shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
and you shall be holy; for I am holy."* --- Leviticus 11:44

This call to holiness is repeated throughout Leviticus (11:44--45; 19:2;
20:7--8).\
Holiness is not ceremonial isolation but **conformity to God's
character**.\
All the ceremonial distinctions --- foods, diseases, discharges, moral
boundaries --- were shadows pointing to the **spiritual purity found in
Christ**.

  טָמֵא        *ṭāmēʾ*               Unclean,       Lev 11:47       Mark 1:40--45 -- Cleansing

  קָדַשׁ        *qāḏaš*               To sanctify    Lev 20:7        John 17:19 -- "I sanctify
                                                                  Myself for them"

  נָזַה        *nāzāh*               To sprinkle    Lev 14:7        Heb 12:24 -- "Blood of

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These words move from the physical realm to the moral and finally to the
spiritual --- tracing the same journey from **law to grace** and from
**shadow to substance**.

**3. Laws of Cleanness and Uncleanness (Leviticus 11--15)**

The sections from Leviticus 11--15 teach that God's people must discern
between the clean and the unclean in every aspect of life. This does not
mean that some animals or conditions were morally sinful; rather, they
symbolized spiritual truths.

**3.1 Clean and Unclean Animals (Leviticus 11)**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Typology:**\
The distinction between clean and unclean points to **spiritual
discernment** --- walking according to the Spirit, not the flesh.
*"Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you."* --- 2
Corinthians 6:17

**Christological Fulfillment:**

In Mark 7:18--19, Jesus declared all foods clean, showing that external
distinctions had served their symbolic purpose. True cleanness comes
from the **heart purified by faith** (Acts 15:9).

**3.2 Purification after Childbirth (Leviticus 12)**

Childbirth, though sacred, rendered a woman ceremonially unclean,
symbolizing the **transmission of sin through human generation** (Ps
51:5). Purification required **a sin offering and a burnt offering**.

Fulfillment: The Virgin Birth breaks the chain of defilement --- *"That
holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God."*
(Luke 1:35)

Mary herself brought the required offering (Luke 2:22--24),
acknowledging that even motherhood stands under redemption.

**3.3 Laws of Leprosy (Leviticus 13--14)**

Leprosy in Scripture is a vivid picture of sin:

- It begins unseen.

- It spreads silently.

- It defiles completely.

- It separates from fellowship.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

*"He shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed seven times."* ---
Leviticus 14:7

**Fulfillment:** Christ cleanses the leper by touch (Mark 1:40--45),
signifying that holiness is **contagious in Him**, not defilement. In
His humanity, He touched corruption without becoming unclean, because
**He is purity itself**.

**3.4 Bodily Discharges and Impurity (Leviticus 15)**

These regulations symbolized that sin flows from within man, defiling
even the most intimate parts of life. Jesus interpreted them
spiritually:

*"What comes out of a man, that defiles him."* --- Mark 7:20--23.

Thus Leviticus 15 anticipates the need for **inward cleansing** ---
fulfilled in the new birth and sanctification by the Spirit (Titus 3:5).

**4. The Sanctity of Blood (Leviticus 17)**

*"For the life (nephesh) of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given
it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls."* ---
Leviticus 17:11

This verse is the theological center of Leviticus.\
Life belongs to God, and blood --- the carrier of life --- must be
treated as sacred.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Principle**        **Leviticus**   **Fulfillment**
  -------------------- --------------- ------------------------------------------
  Life in the blood    Lev 17:11       "This is My blood of the new covenant"
                                       (Matt 26:28)

  Blood prohibited for Lev 17:12       Respect for life's sacredness
  food                                 

  Blood for atonement  Lev 17:11       "Without shedding of blood is no
                                       remission" (Heb 9:22)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Christ's blood is not a symbol but the **very life poured out** for
redemption. It satisfies justice, cleanses conscience, and consecrates
believers (1 Pet 1:2).

**5. Moral and Ethical Holiness (Leviticus 18--20)**

Chapters 18--20 move from ceremonial purity to moral purity --- from the
**shadow** to the **substance** of holiness.

**5.1 Prohibitions (Leviticus 18)**

Forbidden sexual relations represent moral boundaries rooted in divine
order. Israel's holiness was to distinguish them from Egypt and Canaan
--- symbolic of the world's corruption.

In Christ, holiness is not law-keeping but **Spirit-led morality**:\
*"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* --- 1 Thess 4:3.

**5.2 Positive Commands (Leviticus 19)**

This chapter is sometimes called the **Levitical Sermon on the Mount**.
Its repeated phrase, *"I am the LORD,"* anchors every ethical command in
divine character.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Command**        **Reference**   **Christ's Fulfillment**
  ------------------ --------------- ------------------------------------
  Love your neighbor Lev 19:18       Matt 22:39 -- "The second is like
                                     it."

  Honest measures    Lev 19:35--36   Integrity of Christ

  Respect for elders Lev 19:32       Honor in the Kingdom

  Care for the poor  Lev 19:9--10    Christ's compassion in action
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Principle:** True holiness expresses itself in justice, mercy, and
love.

**5.3 Penalties for Sin (Leviticus 20)**

The chapter concludes with the **penalty for defilement** --- death or
separation --- underscoring sin's seriousness. *"You shall therefore be
holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy, and have separated you from the
peoples, that you should be Mine."* (Lev 20:26)

**Christological Fulfillment:**\
Christ bore these penalties in Himself. The holiness demanded by law was
fulfilled and imparted through the Spirit's indwelling (Rom 8:3--4).

**6. Christ the Fulfillment of Cleansing**

  Priest's      Assurance      "Your faith has made you clean" (Mark 5:34)
  declaration                  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleansing in Leviticus was ritual and repeated; in Christ, it is
**spiritual and complete**.\
He is both **the purifier and the purity** itself.

Hebrews 9:13--14 --- *"If the blood of bulls and goats... sanctifies for
the purification of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of
Christ... cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living
God."*

**7. Holiness: The Goal of Cleansing**

Cleansing leads to consecration; holiness is not a condition we achieve
but a r**elationship we maintain**. The refrain "I am the LORD" in
Leviticus 19 appears fifteen times --- God Himself is the measure and
motive of holiness.

  -------------------------------------------------------------

nature** (2 Pet 1:4).

All purity laws converge in the person of Jesus --- **the Clean touching
the unclean to make them clean**.

**9. The Theology of Separation**

The Hebrew root *badal* (בָּדַל) --- "to separate" --- runs throughout
these chapters.\
God divides to sanctify. He separates light from darkness, Israel from
nations, and clean from unclean.

In Christ, this separation becomes inward --- the new creation separated
from the old.

*"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."* --- 2
Corinthians 5:17.

Separation is not withdrawal from the world but **distinction within
it** --- being in the world yet not of it (John 17:15--19).

**10. Doctrinal Synthesis**

1.  **Holiness proceeds from atonement.** Cleansing is grounded in
    sacrifice (Lev 17:11).

2.  **Purity is both positional and practical.** We are made clean in
    Christ and called to walk clean by the Spirit.

3.  **God's holiness defines morality.** Ethics flow from worship.

4.  **Christ fulfills both ceremonial and moral law.** He is the true
    clean One, the purifier of His people.

5.  **The indwelling Spirit applies holiness.** What law commanded,
    grace enables.

"Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for her, that He might
sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word." ---
Ephesians 5:25--26.

**11. Reflection Questions**

1.  How does Levitical cleanness reveal the seriousness of sin and the
    grace of God?

2.  In what ways does Christ's ministry to lepers, women, and sinners
    illustrate the fulfillment of these chapters?

3.  What is the difference between being "separated from" and "separated
    unto"?

4.  How can a believer maintain purity without legalism?

5.  Why is holiness both the cause and the consequence of fellowship
    with God?

**Closing Meditation**

*"You shall be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy, and have separated
you from the peoples, that you should be Mine."* --- Leviticus 20:26

Holiness is not self-made purity but God's ownership expressed in daily
life. The God who cleanses also claims. The blood that redeems also
sanctifies. In Christ, every barrier --- moral, ceremonial, or spiritual
--- is overcome. He is both **the Cleansing Fountain** and **the Holy
Place**. *"Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
God."* --- 2 Corinthians 7:1.
