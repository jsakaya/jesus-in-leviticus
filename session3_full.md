**Session 3 -- Christ in the Priesthood (Leviticus 8-10)**

*"We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the
throne of the Majesty in the heavens."* --- *Hebrews 8:1*

Aaron's priesthood was temporary and symbolic. Christ's priesthood is
eternal and real --- the fulfillment of all Levitical shadows. Every act
in the consecration of the priests (Leviticus 8) points to the Person
and Work of Jesus Christ.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Summary:**\
Aaron = the shadow. Christ = the substance.\
Aaron was chosen, washed, clothed, anointed, consecrated, and fed in the
tabernacle.\
Christ was chosen before the foundation of the world, sinless,
Spirit-anointed, consecrated through obedience unto death, and seated in
the true tabernacle (Heb. 8:1--2).

**1.1 The Superiority of Christ's Priesthood -- Who He Is**

1.  **Superior in Person** -- He is sinless and divine. (Heb. 7:26--28)

2.  **Superior in Order** -- "After the order of Melchizedek." (Heb.
    7:17)

3.  **Superior in Appointment** -- By divine oath, not law. (Heb. 7:21)

Ministers**

4.  **Supreme in Effectiveness** -- Perfected forever those who are
    sanctified. (Heb. 10:14)

2.  **For All Time** -- "He ever lives to make intercession." (Heb.
    7:25)

**1.5 Devotional Reflection**

The priesthood of Aaron ended at the altar; the priesthood of Christ
continues at the throne. Every drop of Levitical blood pointed to His
Cross. Now every prayer of ours rises through His intercession. He is
the Priest who never sleeps, the Advocate who never fails, and the
Mediator who never ceases to love.

**2. The Three Appearances and the Three Eternals** *(Leviticus 9 and
Hebrews 9)*

*"For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands... but into
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."* ---
*Hebrews 9:24*

After the consecration of the priesthood in Leviticus 8, chapter 9
describes the **public inauguration of their ministry**. In this
chapter, the priest (Aaron) moves through **three distinct
appearances**, each prefiguring the redemptive work of Christ --- past,
present, and future.

**2.1. The Three Movements in Leviticus 9**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Leviticus   **Scene**      **The Priest's **Fulfilled in Christ **Significance**
  9**                          Appearance**   (Hebrews 9)**         
  ------------- -------------- -------------- --------------------- -------------------
  **v.7**       **At the       *Appears as    **"He appeared to put **Past:** Christ's
                Altar**        the Offeror*   away sin by the       first appearing on
                                              sacrifice of          earth --- to deal
                                              Himself."** (Heb.     with sin at
                                              9:26)                 Calvary.

  **v.23a**     **In the       *Appears       **"Now to appear in   **Present:**
                Tabernacle**   before God*    the presence of God   Christ's present
                                              for us."** (Heb.      ministry of
                                              9:24)                 intercession in
                                                                    heaven.

  **v.23b**     **Before the   *Appears in    **"He shall appear a  **Future:**
                People**       Public*        second time, apart    Christ's glorious
                                              from sin, unto        return to bless His
                                              salvation."** (Heb.   redeemed people.
                                              9:28)                 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Three Appearances = One Complete Redemption**\
• *He has appeared* --- to put away sin (Past)\
• *He now appears* --- to intercede for us (Present)\
• *He shall appear* --- to bring full salvation (Future)

**2.2. The Three Eternals in Hebrews 9**

Each appearance of Christ corresponds with an **eternal aspect** of His
priestly work --- revealing its perfection and permanence.

  **Hebrews 9:14** --    **Eternal       Power behind His sacrifice ---
  "Through the eternal   Spirit**        connects with **Heb. 9:26 / Lev.
  Spirit"                                9:7**, His past appearing.

  **Hebrews 9:12** --    **Eternal       Result of His heavenly ministry ---
  "Having obtained       Redemption**    connects with **Heb. 9:24 / Lev.
  eternal redemption"                    9:23a**, His present appearing.

  **Hebrews 9:15** --    **Eternal       Outcome of His return --- connects
  "The promise of        Inheritance**   with **Heb. 9:28 / Lev. 9:23b**,
  eternal inheritance"                   His future appearing.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2.4. Theological Insight**

- **One Priest --- Three Appearances --- Three Eternals.**

- In these three appearances, we see the entire span of salvation
  history:

  - *The Cross* --- finished work of atonement.

  - *The Throne* --- ongoing work of intercession.

  - *The Cloud* --- future work of glorification.

He appeared for our **atonement**,\
He appears for our **advocacy**,\
He shall appear for our **acclamation**.

**E. Devotional Reflection**

At the altar, He dealt with sin.In heaven, He represents us. Before the
world, He will soon return in glory. The Levitical priest could only
move from the altar to the tabernacle to the people. But Christ moves
from **the Cross to the Throne to the Cloud** ---\
from **Calvary to the Heavenly Sanctuary to His Coming in Glory.**

"Even so, come, Lord Jesus." --- *Revelation 22:20*
