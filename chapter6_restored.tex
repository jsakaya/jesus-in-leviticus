\chapter{Christ in the Feasts of the Lord}

\textit{Theme: The Prophetic Calendar of Redemption --- Christ in Every Appointed Time.}

\section{Introduction: God's Calendar of Redemption}

Leviticus 23 presents the \textbf{Feasts of the Lord} --- not Israel's feasts, but \textbf{Yahweh's appointed times} (\heb{מוֹעֲדִים} \textit{môʿēdîm}). They form the divine blueprint of God's redemptive history --- every feast a prophetic picture of \textbf{Christ's person and work}.

\begin{scripture}
``These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their seasons.''
\scriptureref{Leviticus 23:4}
\end{scripture}

The Hebrew term \heb{מוֹעֵד} (\textit{môʿēd}) means an \textbf{appointed meeting} --- the time when heaven and earth meet in fellowship through redemption. Each feast, like a link in a chain, unfolds the \textbf{timeline of the Gospel}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Passover --- Christ's death
\item Unleavened Bread --- His burial
\item Firstfruits --- His resurrection
\item Pentecost --- The Spirit's outpouring
\item Trumpets --- His return for the Church
\item Day of Atonement --- Israel's national repentance
\item Tabernacles --- The Kingdom's fullness
\end{itemize}

\section{The Structure of Leviticus 23}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Feast} & \textbf{Month (Hebrew)} & \textbf{Symbolic Meaning} \\
\midrule
I & Sabbath & Weekly & Eternal rest in Christ \\
II & Passover & Nisan 14 & Redemption by blood \\
III & Unleavened Bread & Nisan 15--21 & Separation from sin \\
IV & Firstfruits & Nisan 17 & Resurrection life \\
V & Pentecost (Weeks) & Sivan 6 & Empowerment by the Spirit \\
VI & Trumpets & Tishri 1 & Regathering and resurrection \\
VII & Day of Atonement & Tishri 10 & National repentance \\
VIII & Tabernacles & Tishri 15--22 & God dwelling with men \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Christ's first coming fulfilled the first four feasts; His second coming will fulfill the last three. The gap between Pentecost and Trumpets pictures the \textbf{Church Age} --- the harvest time.

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{The Feast of the Sabbath (Leviticus 23:1--3)}

The weekly Sabbath was the foundation of all feasts --- a continual reminder that rest is found only in the Creator and Redeemer.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
Cessation of work & God's finished creation & Christ's finished redemption (John 19:30) \\
Seventh day & Completion & Eternal rest (Heb.\ 4:9--10) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\begin{scripture}
``Come unto Me\ldots and I will give you rest.''
\scriptureref{Matthew 11:28}
\end{scripture}

Christ is the Sabbath Person --- rest for the weary soul.

\section{The Feast of Passover (Leviticus 23:4--5)}

\textbf{Hebrew:} \heb{פֶּסַח} (\textit{Pesaḥ}) --- ``to pass over.'' \textbf{Date:} 14th day of Nisan. \textbf{Meaning:} Deliverance from judgment through the blood of a lamb.

\begin{scripture}
``When I see the blood, I will pass over you.''
\scriptureref{Exodus 12:13}
\end{scripture}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Symbolism} & \textbf{Fulfillment in Christ} \\
\midrule
Lamb without blemish & Innocence & ``Behold the Lamb of God'' (John 1:29) \\
Blood on doorposts & Substitution & ``Without shedding of blood\ldots'' (Heb.\ 9:22) \\
Roasted with fire & Suffering & ``My God, why have You forsaken Me?'' \\
No bone broken & Integrity & John 19:36 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\textbf{Doctrinal Truth:} Passover is Calvary in type. Christ died on Passover day --- \textit{``Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us''} (1 Cor.\ 5:7). The believer's deliverance from wrath begins here.

\section{The Feast of Unleavened Bread (Leviticus 23:6--8)}

Immediately following Passover, this feast lasted seven days, symbolizing a continual walk of holiness.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
No leaven & Absence of corruption & Christ's sinless body (Heb.\ 7:26) \\
Seven days & Complete devotion & Sanctified life of believers \\
Eating bread of purity & Fellowship with truth & ``Let us keep the feast\ldots with sincerity'' (1 Cor.\ 5:8) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Passover speaks of deliverance; Unleavened Bread speaks of separation. Christ's body ``saw no corruption'' (Acts 2:27); believers are called to live in the purity His death provides.

\section{The Feast of Firstfruits (Leviticus 23:9--14)}

Held on the day after the Sabbath following Passover --- the very morning of Christ's resurrection.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
Sheaf of firstfruits & Beginning of harvest & Christ --- firstfruit of resurrection (1 Cor.\ 15:20) \\
Waving before the Lord & Presentation and acceptance & God accepted Christ's resurrection for us \\
No leavened bread & Sinlessness of resurrection life & New creation holiness \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\begin{scripture}
``Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.''
\scriptureref{1 Corinthians 15:20}
\end{scripture}

Firstfruits marks new creation life --- the dawn of resurrection morning.

\section{The Feast of Weeks / Pentecost (Leviticus 23:15--22)}

\textbf{Hebrew:} \heb{שָׁבוּעוֹת} (\textit{Shābuʿôt}) --- ``weeks''; Greek \textit{Pentēkostē} --- ``fiftieth.'' \textbf{Date:} Fifty days after Firstfruits. \textbf{Meaning:} Thanksgiving for harvest; the completion of redemption.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Element} & \textbf{Symbolism} & \textbf{Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
Two leavened loaves & Jew and Gentile, still imperfect & One new body, the Church \\
Fire and wind imagery & Divine presence & Holy Spirit descending (Acts 2) \\
New grain & New covenant community & Church born at Pentecost \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\textbf{Doctrinal Truth:} The same Spirit who raised Christ now indwells His people. Pentecost is the feast of fullness, the harvest of resurrection life.

\section{The Feast of Trumpets (Leviticus 23:23--25)}

\textbf{Hebrew:} \heb{יוֹם תְּרוּעָה} (\textit{Yōm Tĕrûʿāh}) --- ``Day of Blowing.'' \textbf{Date:} 1st of Tishri (the civil new year). \textbf{Meaning:} Call to remembrance, repentance, and gathering.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Prophetic Meaning} & \textbf{Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
Trumpet blast & Call to assemble & Rapture of the Church (1 Thess.\ 4:16--17) \\
Awakening & Revival and repentance & Israel's awakening \\
New beginning & Renewal of covenant & Restoration of God's people \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

This feast looks forward to the return of Christ and the regathering of Israel, as well as the resurrection of the saints.

\section{The Day of Atonement (Leviticus 23:26--32)}

Already studied in Chapter 4, here it reappears as the sixth feast, corresponding prophetically to Israel's future repentance.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X}
\toprule
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Leviticus} & \textbf{Prophetic Fulfillment} \\
\midrule
National humiliation & Lev.\ 23:27 & Israel's mourning for the Pierced One (Zech.\ 12:10) \\
Fasting, affliction & Lev.\ 23:29 & ``They shall look on Him whom they pierced'' \\
High priest entering & Lev.\ 16; 23:27 & Christ appearing to Israel as Redeemer \\
Cleansing and forgiveness & Lev.\ 16:30 & ``All Israel shall be saved'' (Rom.\ 11:26) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The Day of Atonement, fulfilled once at Calvary, will one day be applied nationally when Israel recognizes her Messiah.

\section{The Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:33--44)}

\textbf{Hebrew:} \heb{סֻכּוֹת} (\textit{Sukkōṯ}) --- booths, tents. \textbf{Duration:} 15th--22nd of Tishri. \textbf{Meaning:} Joyful remembrance of God's presence in the wilderness and anticipation of His dwelling among men.

\begin{table}[h]

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\textbf{Prophetic Vision:} Tabernacles points to the Millennial Reign of Christ, when the true Immanuel (``God with us'') reigns in righteousness and peace.

\begin{scripture}
``Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men.''
\scriptureref{Revelation 21:3}
\end{scripture}

\section{The Theology of the Feasts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Redemption} (Passover) --- The Lamb slain.
\item \textbf{Separation} (Unleavened Bread) --- The old life removed.
\item \textbf{Resurrection} (Firstfruits) --- New life begun.
\item \textbf{Empowerment} (Pentecost) --- Spirit poured out.
\item \textbf{Regathering} (Trumpets) --- Saints summoned.
\item \textbf{Reconciliation} (Atonement) --- Israel restored.
\item \textbf{Rejoicing} (Tabernacles) --- God dwelling forever.
\end{enumerate}

These feasts are not random holy days but a sevenfold panorama of the Gospel --- from cross to crown.

\section{Christ the Center of All Appointed Times}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Divine Pattern} & \textbf{Leviticus} & \textbf{Fulfillment in Christ} \\
\midrule
``Holy convocations'' & 23:2 & Church, the gathered people of God \\
``In their seasons'' & 23:4 & ``In the fullness of time'' (Gal.\ 4:4) \\
``Offerings made by fire'' & 23:8, 18 & The work of the Spirit applying the cross \\
``Sabbath rest'' & 23:3 & Eternal rest in Christ (Heb.\ 4:9--10) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Every feast begins and ends with rest --- all divine activity starts and concludes with Christ's finished work.

\section{Closing Meditation}

\begin{scripture}
``These are the feasts of the LORD\ldots which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations.''
\scriptureref{Leviticus 23:37}
\end{scripture}

From the first lamb slain in Egypt to the final harvest joy of Tabernacles, Christ is the center of God's calendar. Every trumpet blast, every loaf of unleavened bread, every booth and every sheaf --- all speak of Him.

\begin{scripture}
``In the fullness of time God sent forth His Son.''
\scriptureref{Galatians 4:4}
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}
``The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.''
\scriptureref{John 1:14}
\end{scripture}

The feasts begin with blood and end with glory --- the same pattern by which the believer walks: from redemption to rest, from cross to crown.
