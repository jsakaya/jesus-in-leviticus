**Christ in the Covenant, the Sabbath, and the Jubilee (Leviticus
25--26)**

**Theme:** *Rest, Redemption, and Restoration --- Christ the Lord of the
Sabbath and the Proclaimer of Jubilee.*

**1. Introduction: The Rhythm of Divine Rest**

Leviticus 25--26 concludes the covenantal section of the book by
revealing three great theological realities:

1.  **Rest (Sabbath and Sabbatical Year)** --- rest from labor and trust
    in divine provision.

2.  **Redemption (Jubilee)** --- liberty and restoration by grace.

3.  **Relationship (Covenant Blessings)** --- fellowship with God
    conditioned upon obedience, fulfilled in Christ.

The moral pulse of Leviticus beats in the rhythm of **"Rest and
Release."**\
Every seventh day, every seventh year, and every fiftieth year
proclaimed that **God owns the land, the people, and time itself.**

"The land is Mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with Me." ---
Leviticus 25:23

In Christ, this rhythm reaches its eternal fulfillment:

- He is **the true Sabbath** --- rest for the soul (Matt 11:28--29).

- He is **the true Redeemer** --- who proclaims the acceptable year of
  the Lord (Luke 4:18--19).

- He is **the true Covenant Mediator** --- securing everlasting
  blessings (Heb 8:6).

                                   steadfast love                       
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These words together form the grammar of grace:\
**rest** (Sabbath), **release** (Jubilee), and **relationship**
(covenant).\
All three converge in Christ, who redeems time, land, and people for
God.

**3. The Sabbath Year --- Trusting God's Provision (Leviticus 25:1--7)**

Every **seventh year**, the land was to rest.\
The Israelites were forbidden to sow, reap, or prune; they lived on what
God provided spontaneously.

"The Sabbath of the land shall provide food for you." --- Leviticus 25:6

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Principle**     **Meaning**           **Fulfillment in Christ**
  ----------------- --------------------- --------------------------------
  Land rest         Creation's rhythm     Christ, Lord of creation
                    restored              

  Trust in divine   Dependence on God,    "Your Father knows what you
  supply            not toil              need" (Matt 6:32)

  Equality among    All shared freely     Fellowship of the saints (Acts
  people                                  2:44--45)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sabbath year was not laziness but **faith expressed in rest** ---
the outward picture of inward confidence in God.\
In Christ, this rest becomes spiritual reality:

"We who have believed enter into rest." --- Hebrews 4:3.

**4. The Year of Jubilee --- The Trumpet of Liberty (Leviticus
25:8--55)**

**4.1 The Institution of Jubilee**

Every **fiftieth year**, after seven sabbatical cycles, the trumpet
(*yōvēl*) sounded on the **Day of Atonement**, proclaiming liberty
throughout the land.

"You shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all
the land to all its inhabitants." --- Leviticus 25:10

This became Israel's **year of restoration** --- debts forgiven, slaves
freed, property returned.

**4.2 The Threefold Liberation**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Area**          **Action**      **Spiritual Fulfillment**
  ----------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------
  **Debt**          All debts       Forgiveness through Christ's blood (Eph 1:7)
                    cancelled       

  **Slavery**       All slaves      Deliverance from sin's bondage (Rom 6:18)
                    released        

  **Inheritance**   Land restored   Restoration of spiritual inheritance in
                                    Christ (Eph 1:11)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Jubilee trumpet blew on the Day of Atonement --- liberty rooted in
atonement.\
True freedom flows from forgiveness.

**4.3 The Theology of Jubilee**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Symbol**            **Meaning**        **Christological Truth**
  --------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------
  Trumpet blast         Announcement of    Gospel proclamation
                        grace              

  Return to possession  Restoration of     "Heirs of God" (Rom 8:17)
                        inheritance        

  Release of servants   Redemption by      "If the Son sets you free..."
                        grace              (John 8:36)

  No sowing / reaping   Dependence on      Grace, not works
                        provision          

  Liberty year begins   Freedom through    "The acceptable year of the
  at Atonement          blood              Lord" (Luke 4:18--19)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Jubilee was both **social legislation** and **spiritual prophecy**
--- a foretaste of the **Kingdom age**, when creation itself will be
delivered from bondage (Rom 8:21).

**5. The Kinsman-Redeemer (Leviticus 25:23--55)**

The laws of redemption introduce one of the most beautiful titles of
Christ --- **the Go'el (Redeemer)**.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Provision**         **Description**       **Fulfillment in Christ**
  --------------------- --------------------- ---------------------------
  Redemption of         A near relative could Christ, our Brother,
  property (25:25)      buy back lost land    restores lost inheritance

  Redemption of persons A kinsman could       Christ redeems us from
  (25:47--49)           redeem enslaved       slavery to sin
                        family                

  Redemption            Only a near kinsman   Christ became man to
  conditioned on        qualified             qualify as Redeemer (Heb
  relationship                                2:14--15)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

"I know that my Redeemer (*Go'el*) lives." --- Job 19:25\
"In Him we have redemption through His blood." --- Ephesians 1:7

The book of Ruth later illustrates this principle --- Boaz as the
*Go'el* foreshadows Christ, the Redeemer who marries His Bride and
restores her inheritance.

**6. Chart --- Sabbath Year vs. Jubilee Year**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**       **Sabbath Year**     **Jubilee Year**
  ----------------- -------------------- -------------------------
  Frequency         Every 7th year       Every 50th year

  Land              Rests                Returns to original owner

  Debts             Suspended            Cancelled

  Servants          Rest                 Released

  Spiritual meaning Rest in God's        Restoration in God's
                    provision            grace

  Fulfillment in    Spiritual rest (Matt Full redemption (Luke
  Christ            11:28)               4:18--19)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Together, these years show **rest and restoration** --- the essence of
redemption.\
The Sabbath year teaches **faith**; the Jubilee year proclaims
**freedom**.

**7. The Covenant Blessings and Curses (Leviticus 26)**

After the laws of rest and release, God outlines the **conditions of
covenant relationship** --- obedience bringing blessing, rebellion
bringing discipline.

**7.1 Blessings for Obedience (26:1--13)**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Blessing**       **Description**       **Fulfillment in Christ**
  ------------------ --------------------- -------------------------------
  Rain in season     Fruitfulness and      Spiritual fruit (John 15:5)
                     provision             

  Peace in the land  Security              Peace with God (Rom 5:1)

  Victory over       Triumph               "More than conquerors" (Rom
  enemies                                  8:37)

  God's presence     Tabernacle among them "God with us" (Matt 1:23)

  Covenant           Fellowship            New covenant in His blood (Luke
  confirmation                             22:20)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I will walk among you, and be your God, and you shall be My people."
--- Leviticus 26:12\
This verse anticipates **Immanuel --- God with us**, the incarnate
fulfillment of covenant presence.

**7.2 Curses for Disobedience (26:14--39)**

When Israel disobeyed, the land itself would rest by force during exile
(26:34--35).\
Every unkept Sabbath year would be repaid --- fulfilled in the
Babylonian captivity (2 Chron 36:21).

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Principle**        **Leviticus**   **Fulfillment**
  -------------------- --------------- ---------------------------------------
  Discipline for sin   Lev 26:18       Heb 12:6 -- "Whom the Lord loves He
                                       chastens."

  Exile and desolation Lev 26:33       National judgment for unbelief

  Confession and       Lev 26:40--45   Israel's future repentance and
  restoration                          restoration (Rom 11:26)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even in judgment, mercy prevailed:

"Yet for all that... I will not cast them away... I will remember My
covenant." --- Leviticus 26:44--45.

This steadfast mercy (*ḥesed*) anticipates the **new covenant grace**
revealed in Christ.

**9. The Fulfillment in Christ: Rest, Release, and Relationship**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Theme**          **Leviticus Shadow**  **Fulfillment in Christ**
  ------------------ --------------------- ------------------------------------
  **Rest**           Sabbath year          "Come unto Me and rest." (Matt
                                           11:28)

  **Release**        Jubilee               "Proclaim liberty to the captives."
                                           (Luke 4:18)

  **Redemption**     Go'el                 "In Him we have redemption." (Eph
                     (kinsman-redeemer)    1:7)

  **Relationship**   Covenant fellowship   "Abide in Me and I in you." (John
                                           15:4)

  **Restoration**    Return of land        "All things reconciled" (Col 1:20)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, the final chapters of Leviticus culminate in Christ ---\
**the Rest-Giver, the Redeemer, and the Restorer.**

**10. Doctrinal Synthesis**

1.  **Sabbath typifies salvation rest.**\
    Rest is not inactivity but trust --- faith ceases from self-effort.

2.  **Jubilee prefigures full redemption.**\
    Freedom from sin, debt, and bondage begins now and will be completed
    at Christ's return.

3.  **The Covenant reveals God's faithfulness.**\
    Even when His people fail, He remembers His covenant of mercy.

4.  **Christ unites all three truths.**\
    He gives rest to the weary, liberty to the captive, and covenant
    relationship to the redeemed.

"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me... to preach deliverance to the
captives, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." --- Luke
4:18--19.

**11. Reflection and Discussion**

1.  How do Sabbath and Jubilee together portray the fullness of
    salvation?

2.  Why must atonement precede liberty in the Jubilee sequence?

3.  How is Christ both our Redeemer and our Rest?

4.  What does God's remembrance of His covenant teach about grace and
    discipline?

5.  How can believers live the Jubilee life today --- spiritually free,
    yet humbly dependent?

**Closing Meditation**

"This shall be a Jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his
possession." --- Leviticus 25:10\
"If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed."
--- John 8:36

Christ is our eternal Jubilee.\
He releases us from sin's slavery, restores our lost inheritance, and
reconciles us to the Father.\
The Sabbath calls us to rest; the Jubilee calls us to rejoice; the
Covenant calls us to relationship.\
In Him, **time itself finds its fulfillment**, for He is both the
Beginning and the End --- the Alpha and the Omega.
