**Session 2: Christ in the offeings (Leviticus 1-7)**

**1. The Incomprehensible Christ Revealed in the Offerings**

When we begin studying the offerings, we must remember that **Christ
Himself is infinite**. His Person cannot be measured, mapped, or
mastered. Paul says that even **one** glory of Christ --- His **love**
--- has **breadth, length, depth, and height** (Eph. 3:18). If **one
attribute** of Jesus is beyond human comprehension, **how much more**
the fullness of **Christ Himself**!

The five offerings are not five separate doctrines, but **five windows**
into the same glorious Person --- each revealing one facet of His
inexhaustible beauty. **All of Scripture shines with glimpses of this
vast Christ.** Every offering, every servant, every moment in God's
dealings with His people reveals a facet of His glory:

**Moses** --- His forbearance and faithfulness, **David** --- His heart
after God's own heart, **Joseph** --- His suffering and exaltation,
**Aaron** --- His priestly intercession, **The five offerings** --- the
fullness of His redeeming love

Each offering unveils one dimension of His infinite Person --- the
**breadth** of His fellowship, the **length** of His obedience, the
**depth** of His suffering, and the **height** of His devotion to the
Father. No single type can contain Him; yet together they trace the
contours of His perfect, completed Cross. **Every offering is a facet of
Jesus' one perfect sacrifice.** *"Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away
the sin of the world!"* (John 1:29)

**God's Order and Man's Order**

**To God,** everything begins with **His Son**. He first beholds **the
perfect obedience of Christ**, the Finished Work offered up to Him as a
sweet aroma.Therefore, in God's order, the path **begins with Christ's
perfection and ends in fellowship**, because He sees us **in His Son**,
already accepted.

**To man,** the journey begins elsewhere. We start with **our sin,
guilt, and distance**. Only then do we move toward the altar, toward
cleansing and acceptance. So in man's order, the path **begins with sin
and ends in peace**, because we travel from guilt to grace.

**Thus Scripture presents both orders side by side:**

- **God begins with the Burnt Offering** --- Christ's perfect devotion.

- **Man begins with the Sin Offering** --- our deep need.

One is **God's view from above**; the other is **man's experience from
below**. Both meet in **Christ**, where God's satisfaction and man's
peace become one.

Though God commanded Israel to circumcise the flesh, His real desire was
the circumcision of the heart. The outward act was only a shadow of an
inward reality. Likewise, the sacrifices, rituals, washings, and
priesthood were never ends in themselves --- they pointed to deeper
spiritual truths. Every external command anticipated its inner
fulfilment in Christ: the true circumcision, the perfect sacrifice, the
final cleansing, and the eternal Priesthood. What the law required
outwardly, God intended inwardly --- and Christ completes it fully.2.2

  1\. Nature of **Sins of Ignorance** Christ cleanses the      Lev 4; Num
  Sin           (*shegāgāh*) ---      **conscience**, removing 15:27--28; Heb
                failures, mistakes,   both the act and the     9:14
                weaknesses, blindness stain                    

                **Presumptuous Sins** Christ shows **mercy**   Num 15:30--31;
                ("with a high hand")  to repentant rebels; His Acts 9; Heb
                --- deliberate,       blood reaches beyond the 7:25; Ps 32:5
                defiant rebellion     Law's limits             

  2\. Provision Sin offering          Christ's blood provides  Lev 4:20, 26,
  under the Law provided;             **complete forgiveness** 31; Heb 9:14
                **forgiveness         and inward cleansing     
                pronounced**                                   

                **No sacrifice**      Christ receives even     Num 15:30--31;
                provided; offender    **high-handed sinners**  Ps 51:1--4; 1
                "cut off"             who repent (e.g., David, Tim 1:13--16
                                      Paul)                    

  3\. Purpose   Teach dependence on   Christ is the **final    Heb 10:1--4, 14
  of the Law    atonement; awaken the sacrifice**, fulfilling  
                conscience            what the Law pointed to  

                Expose the pride and  Christ brings **grace    John 1:17; Rom
                rebellion of the      beyond the Law** ---     5:20
                heart; limit of the   "grace and truth came    
                Law's power           through Jesus Christ"    

  4\. OT        Forgiveness and       Full cleansing: "purge   Lev 4; Heb 9:14
  Outcome       restored access       your conscience"         

                No remedy; judgment   Grace extended: "He is   Heb 7:25
                and exclusion         able to save to the      
                                      uttermost"               

  5\.           Christ's blood        "The blood of Jesus      Heb 9:14; 1
  Fulfillment   cleanses **sins       Christ... **cleanses us  John 1:7
  in Christ's   committed in          from all sin**" ---      
  Blood         ignorance**           **all** includes both    
                                      categories               

                Christ's sacrifice    Mercy to David (Ps 51),  Ps 51:1--7; 1
                reaches beyond the    mercy to Paul (1 Tim     Tim 1:13--16;
                Law to **presumptuous 1:13--16), mercy to      Luke 23:34
                sinners** who repent  rebels (Luke 23:34)      
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Law forgave only sins of ignorance, but the blood of Christ cleanses
both---our weaknesses and our rebellions---bringing grace where the Law
could only condemn.

## 7. Outside the Camp

"Outside the Camp" and the Two Hebrew Words for "Burn". Leviticus uses
two different Hebrew verbs for "burn," and each carries a distinct
spiritual meaning. One speaks of God's delight, the other of God's
judgment --- and both meet in Christ at the Cross.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Verb**   **Meaning**   **Location**   **Symbolism**    **Fulfilled in
                                                           Christ**
  ---------- ------------- -------------- ---------------- ----------------------
  qāṭar      To rise as    On the altar   Acceptance and   "A sweet-smelling
  (קָטַר)      incense                      fragrance        aroma" (Eph. 5:2)

  śāraph     To burn in    Outside the    Rejection and    "Suffered outside the
  (שָׂרַף)      judgment      camp           curse-bearing    gate" (Heb. 13:12)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why it matters:

- *qāṭar* = God's delight in Christ's obedience

- *śāraph* = God's judgment on sin placed on Christ

At Calvary, the fragrance of His obedience and the fire of judgment met
in one place. At the Cross, Christ was both the fragrant offering on the
altar and the judged sacrifice outside the camp.

                                      categories              

                Christ's sacrifice    Mercy to David (Ps 51), Ps 51:1--7; 1
                reaches beyond the    mercy to Paul (1 Tim    Tim 1:13--16;
                Law to **presumptuous 1:13--16), mercy to     Luke 23:34
                sinners** who repent  rebels (Luke 23:34)

The Law forgave only sins of ignorance, but the blood of Christ cleanses
both---our weaknesses and our rebellions---bringing grace where the Law
could only condemn.

The different ways the Grain Offering was prepared---oven, pan,
griddle---reveal the various dimensions of Christ's sufferings and the
hidden beauty of His sinless life at home and in public.

The Grain Offering reveals the inward beauty of
Christ---Spirit-conceived, Spirit-filled, sinless, fragrant to God, and
nourishment to His people.

It was prepared at home in many ways---baked in the oven, cooked on a
pan, or pressed on a griddle (Lev. 2:4--7). These different methods show
the varied pressures and hidden sufferings Christ endured: the unseen
inward agony known only to the Father, the public trials and rejections
before men, and the deep inward sorrow of Gethsemane. Every form of
preparation was thoughtful and personal, reminding us that Christ's
perfect humanity was shaped in the ordinary, hidden places of daily life
before it was offered to God.

**Three-fold Glories of the Lord Jesus Christ**

**The Inward Beauty and Moral Glory of Christ:**

The Grain Offering reveals the **inward, hidden beauty** of
Christ---Spirit-conceived, Spirit-filled, sinless, fragrant to God, and
nourishment to His people. It was prepared **at home** before being
offered: baked in the **oven** (hidden heat), cooked on the **pan**
(open, visible heat), or pressed on the **griddle** (steady, penetrating
heat) (Lev. 2:4--7). These preparations symbolize the varied pressures
Christ endured---His unseen inward sorrows known only to the Father, His
public trials before men, and His deep inward agony in Gethsemane. In
every circumstance, the "fine flour" of His character remained perfectly
even, perfectly pure, and perfectly fragrant.

His **personal glory** as the eternal Son was veiled, seen only by faith
(Matt. 16:16) or by divine unveiling on the mount (Matt. 17:1--9). His
**official glory** as the Lord of angels was restrained---He walked in
lowliness, though He could have summoned *"twelve legions of angels"*
(Matt. 26:53). But His **moral glory** could never be hidden. He knew
when to submit to His mother (Luke 2:51), when to set aside her claims
(Luke 8:21; John 2:3--4), and when to honor her unsought at the Cross
(John 19:27). This flawless balance is exactly what the *fine flour*
portrays.

His relation to the world was equally perfect. To its **temptations**,
He was a **Conqueror**, refusing all its attractions. To its
**pollutions and enmity**, He was a **Sufferer**, grieved by its evil
and opposed by its spirit. To its **misery**, He was a **Benefactor**,
healing, blessing, teaching, feeding, and returning good for evil.
Whether hidden in the house, tested in the open, or pressed in deep
sorrow, Christ remained the same---**the Bread of God**, fragrant to the
Father and life for His people (John 6:35, 57).
