# **Session -- 4 -** CHRIST IN THE DAY OF ATONEMENT (LEVITICUS 16)

**Theme:** *The once-a-year atonement of Israel is fulfilled in the
once-for-all atonement of Christ.*

**1. Introduction: The Pinnacle of Leviticus**

Among the thirty-nine chapters of Exodus, the twenty-seven chapters of
Leviticus, and the long journey of Numbers and Deuteronomy, one chapter
rises like the **pinnacle of a holy mountain** --- **Leviticus 16**, the
Day of Atonement.

If the book of Leviticus is a sanctuary, then chapter 16 is the **Holy
of Holies**.\
If Leviticus is a mountain, then chapter 16 is the **summit**.\
If Leviticus is a lens, then chapter 16 is its **clearest focus**.

Every law, every offering, every priestly function, every clean-unclean
distinction ascends toward this central chapter --- the one day when
**one man** entered **one place** with **one offering**, for **one
nation**, pointing to the final work of **One Perfect Christ** for **all
nations**.

**2. Meaning of "Atonement"**

The Hebrew word **"kaphar"** means "to cover," "to make reconciliation,"
or "to make satisfaction." --- the three dimensions of true atonement.
**eaning of "Atonement".** It comes from a root meaning "to smear or
cover over." In the Old Testament sense, sin was *covered* temporarily;
in the New Testament, through Christ, sin is *removed* eternally.

**Distinction:**

- **Old Covenant:** Sin covered until Christ (Rom. 3:25 -- "God passed
  over the sins previously committed").

- **New Covenant:** Sin taken away forever (John 1:29 -- "Behold, the
  Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world").

Thus, Leviticus 16 shows the **shadow**, while Hebrews 9--10 shows the
**substance**. The blood of bulls and goats could cover sin; only the
blood of the Son could cancel it.

**4. The Central Day in Israel's Calendar**

The Day of Atonement (*Yom Kippur*) was the holiest and most solemn day
in Israel's entire year. It occurred on the tenth day of the seventh
month (Tishri), following the Feast of Trumpets and preceding the Feast
of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:26--32). Unlike other days of feasting and joy,
this was a day of affliction, repentance, and cleansing.

- Every Israelite was commanded to "afflict his soul" (Lev. 23:27).

- All work ceased.

- The nation stood still as their high priest entered the Holy of Holies
  once a year (Heb. 9:7).

It was the only time the veil was passed, the mercy seat approached, and
the blood carried within the veil. Everything about the day declared:
"Access to God is not open except through blood, and through a
mediator."

Purpose of the Day

- To cleanse the sanctuary from the defilement caused by the sins of the
  people (Lev. 16:16).

- To reconcile the people to God (v. 30).

- To renew fellowship between a holy God and a sinful nation.

In shadow, it anticipated the one eternal atonement accomplished at the
Cross.

Isaiah 63:3

**5. The Three Main Participants**

**5.1 The High Priest (Aaron)**

- Represented the entire nation before God.

- On that day, he laid aside his golden garments and wore **simple white
  linen** (Lev. 16:4), symbolizing humility and purity.

- Type of **Christ**, who "made Himself of no reputation" and took "the
  form of a servant" (Phil. 2:7).

Aaron entered the Holy of Holies with fear and trembling; Christ entered
heaven itself in triumph and glory.

**5.2 The Two Goats**

- They formed **one offering** for sin (Lev. 16:5).

- One was **slain**, the other **sent away** --- two aspects of one
  atonement:

  - **The slain goat**: Sin judged before God.

  - **The scapegoat**: Sin removed from man's sight.

**5.3 The People**

- They waited outside the sanctuary, depending wholly on the priest's
  success.

- Their peace and purity rested on whether the atonement was accepted.

- *In Christ, believers are no longer waiting outside but have "boldness
  to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus" (Heb. 10:19).*

**6. Key Actions on the Day - The High Priest as Type of Christ**

**6.1 His Preparation (vv. 3--4)**

He washed with water and put on **plain linen garments**, laying aside
his usual robe of glory and beauty. **Typology:** Christ, though divine,
laid aside His glory to humble Himself and take the form of a servant
(Phil 2 : 7--8; John 17:19)

**6.2 His Personal Sin Offering (v. 6)**

Aaron offered a bull for himself --- showing that **Levitical priests
were sinners**. Aaron had to offer a bull for his own sins and for his
household. Before representing the people, Aaron needed cleansing;
Christ, sinless, represents us perfectly.

*Contrast:* Christ needed no such offering --- "He knew no sin" (2 Cor.
5:21; Heb. 7:26--27).

**6.3 The Slain Goat --- Blood Sprinkled (vv. 15--19)**

The goat was killed, and its blood was carried within the veil. The
blood was sprinkled upon and before the mercy seat --- seven times.
*Type:* Christ's blood presented before the throne of God in heaven.
*Hebrews 9:12* --- "Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His
own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all."

**6.4 His Entrance within the Veil (vv. 11--14)**

He entered the Most Holy Place carrying blood, surrounded by a cloud of
incense lest he die. **Typology:** Christ entered "into heaven itself,
now to appear in the presence of God for us" (Heb 9 : 24).

**6.5. The Two Goats: Dual Aspect of Atonement**

Two goats were taken **for one sin offering** (16 : 5) --- not two
sacrifices but **two halves of one act**.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Goat**      **Action**       **Meaning**       **Fulfillment in Christ**
  ------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------------------
  **The slain   Blood sprinkled  *Propitiation*    "God set forth Christ as
  goat**        on the mercy     --- satisfaction  a propitiation through
                seat             of God's justice  faith in His blood" (Rom
                                                   3 : 25)

  **The         Bearing          *Expiation* ---   "Behold, the Lamb of God
  scapegoat     confessed sins   removal of sin    who takes away the sin of
  (ʿAzāzēl)**   into the         from the people   the world" (John 1 : 29)
                wilderness                         
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus one goat represents **Godward satisfaction**, the other **manward
removal** --- both fulfilled in the Cross.

**6.6 The Burnt Offering and Washing (vv. 23--28)**

After completing the atonement, the priest changed garments and offered
burnt offerings of consecration. *Type:* Christ's resurrection and
ascension --- His offering wholly accepted, His work completed. Linen
clothes.

**6.7 The Blood Sprinkled Seven Times**

"He shall sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat
seven times." (Lev 16 : 14)

**Seven** signifies completion. Every drop testified that atonement was
fully accomplished.\
Hebrews 9 : 12 declares, *"He entered once for all into the holy
places... by means of His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption."*

**6.8 The Scapegoat Sent Away**

Aaron laid both hands on the live goat, confessing all the sins of
Israel. The goat was sent away into a desolate land, symbolically
carrying their guilt far from them.

*Fulfilment:* "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He
removed our transgressions from us." (Ps. 103:12). *1 Peter 2:24* ---
"He bore our sins in His own body on the tree."

**Spiritual meaning:** The first goat satisfies divine justice. The
second removes human guilt. Together they portray the **twofold result
of Calvary**: *forgiveness before God* and *cleansing of conscience.*

Psalm 103 : 12 -- "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He
removed our transgressions from us."\
1 John 1 : 9 -- "He is faithful and just to forgive... and to cleanse."

**6.9 The Burning Outside the Camp**

"The bull and the goat whose blood was brought in to make atonement...
shall be burned outside the camp." (16 : 27)

This points directly to **Hebrews 13 : 11-12**:

"Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people
through His own blood."

The burning outside symbolizes rejection, shame, and complete
consumption of sin --- all borne by Christ on the Cross.

**6.10 The Sabbath of Rest**

The day concluded with **absolute rest** (16 : 29-31). Israel was
commanded to do no work, for atonement was entirely the priest's task.

Typologically, salvation is by grace alone: "He sat down" (Heb 10 : 12).
"We who have believed enter into rest" (Heb 4 : 3).

**6.11 The Annual vs. the Eternal**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Contrast**   **Day of Atonement**  **Christ's Atonement**
  -------------- --------------------- --------------------------------
  Frequency      Every year            Once for all (Heb 9 : 26)

  Priest         Many, mortal          One, eternal

  Blood          Of animals            Of Christ

  Sanctuary      Earthly, symbolic     Heavenly, real

  Result         Temporary covering    Eternal redemption

  Access         Restricted            Open to all believers

  Memory of sin  Continual             Sin remembered no more (Heb 10 :
                                       17)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, **Leviticus 16 prefigures Hebrews 9--10**: the same structure, but
fulfilled by a sinless, immortal High Priest.

**6.12 The Mercy Seat and the Cross**

The *kappōret* (mercy seat) was the golden lid covering the ark of the
covenant, overshadowed by cherubim. Beneath lay the tablets of the law
--- God's righteous standard; above hovered His glory. Only when blood
was sprinkled did judgment and mercy meet.

"Righteousness and peace have kissed each other." --- Psalm 85 : 10.\
"Whom God put forward as a *hilastērion* (mercy seat) by His blood." ---
Romans 3 : 25.

At the Cross, the blood of Christ satisfied the law beneath and revealed
the glory above.\
The place of judgment became the throne of grace.

**6.13 Doctrinal Synthesis**

1.  **Substitution** -- The innocent died for the guilty (the slain
    goat).

2.  **Identification** -- The sins were confessed and transferred (the
    scapegoat).

3.  **Propitiation** -- God's holiness satisfied by blood on the mercy
    seat.

4.  **Expiation** -- Sin removed and remembered no more.

5.  **Access** -- The veil opened; believers enter boldly (Heb 10 :
    19-22).

6.  **Intercession** -- Christ now appears for us continually.

7.  **Rest** -- The finished work invites faith, not labor.

*"By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being
sanctified."* --- Hebrews 10 : 14.

  Rest of the day    Finished work        Believers' rest in grace
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

**6.15 Theological Implications**

- **The cross unites justice and mercy.** God remains holy while
  justifying sinners.

- **The blood of Christ opens permanent access.** No veil, no
  repetition.

- **The believer's conscience is cleansed.** Not merely forgiven but
  purified (Heb 9 : 14).

- **The atonement is once for all.** Nothing can be added; all else is
  testimony, not repetition.

- **Christ continues as Intercessor.** The same High Priest who died now
  lives for us (Heb 7 : 25).

**6.16 Devotional Reflection**

When Aaron emerged from the Holy of Holies, the people waited in silent
expectation; when he appeared, they rejoiced --- the atonement was
accepted. Likewise, the disciples saw the risen Christ --- proof that
God's justice was satisfied.

"When He had made purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand
of the Majesty on high." --- Hebrews 1 : 3.

The Day of Atonement therefore speaks of **Calvary (atonement
accomplished), the Resurrection (atonement accepted), and the Session
(atonement applied).**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The **shadow** (Leviticus 16) reveals the holiness of God and the
distance between God and man. The **substance** (Hebrews 9) reveals the
love of God and the nearness made possible through Christ. The Day of
Atonement was a **day of fear**; Calvary made it a **day of access.**The
High Priest in Israel had to exit; **our High Priest never leaves the
presence of God.**
