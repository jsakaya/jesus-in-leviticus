**Session 6 - Christ in the Feasts of the Lord (Leviticus 23)**

**Theme:** *The Prophetic Calendar of Redemption --- Christ in Every
Appointed Time.*

**1. Introduction: God's Calendar of Redemption**

Leviticus 23 presents the **Feasts of the Lord** --- not Israel's
feasts, but **Yahweh's appointed times** (*môʿēdîm*). They are the
divine blueprint of God's redemptive history --- every feast a prophetic
picture of **Christ's person and work**.

*"These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, which
you shall proclaim in their seasons."* --- Leviticus 23:4

The Hebrew term *môʿēd* (מוֹעֵד) means an **appointed meeting** --- the
time when heaven and earth meet in fellowship through redemption. Each
feast, like a link in a chain, unfolds the **timeline of the Gospel**:

- Passover --- Christ's death

- Unleavened Bread --- His burial

- Firstfruits --- His resurrection

- Pentecost --- The Spirit's outpouring

- Trumpets --- His return for the Church

- Day of Atonement --- Israel's national repentance

- Tabernacles --- The Kingdom's fullness

**2. The Structure of Leviticus 23**

                                Calendar)**

                (Weeks)                                Spirit

  VI            Trumpets        Tishri 1               Regathering and
                                                       resurrection

  VII           Day of          Tishri 10              National repentance
                Atonement                              

  VIII          Tabernacles     Tishri 15--22          God dwelling with men
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first four feasts were fulfilled **in Christ's first coming**; the
last three will be fulfilled **in His second coming**. The gap between
Pentecost and Trumpets pictures the **Church Age** --- the harvest time.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. The Feast of the Sabbath (Leviticus 23:1--3)**

The weekly Sabbath was the foundation of all feasts --- a continual
reminder that **rest is found only in the Creator and Redeemer**.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Symbol**     **Meaning**        **Fulfillment**
  -------------- ------------------ ---------------------------------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

*"Come unto Me... and I will give you rest."* --- Matthew 11:28\
Christ is the Sabbath Person --- **rest for the weary soul.**

**5. The Feast of Passover (Leviticus 23:4--5)**

- **Hebrew:** *Pesaḥ* (פֶּסַח) --- "to pass over."

- **Date:** 14th day of Nisan.

- **Meaning:** Deliverance from judgment through the blood of a lamb.

  Blood on doorposts Substitution    "Without shedding of blood..." (Heb
                                     9:22)

  Roasted with fire  Suffering       "My God, why have You forsaken Me?"

  No bone broken     Integrity       John 19:36
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Doctrinal Truth:**

Passover is **Calvary in type**. Christ died on Passover day ---
*"Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us"* (1 Cor 5:7). The believer's
deliverance from wrath begins here.

**6. The Feast of Unleavened Bread (Leviticus 23:6--8)**

Immediately following Passover, this feast lasted **seven days**,
symbolizing **a continual walk of holiness**.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Symbol**      **Meaning**         **Fulfillment**

  purity          truth               sincerity and truth" (1 Cor 5:8)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Passover speaks of **deliverance**; Unleavened Bread speaks of
**separation**. Christ's body "saw no corruption" (Acts 2:27); believers
are called to live in the purity His death provides.

**7. The Feast of Firstfruits (Leviticus 23:9--14)**

Held on **the day after the Sabbath** following Passover --- the very
morning of Christ's resurrection.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This feast looks forward to **the return of Christ** and the
**regathering of Israel**, as well as the **resurrection of the
saints**.

The Day of Atonement, fulfilled once at Calvary, will one day be
**applied nationally** when Israel recognizes her Messiah.

**13. The Theology of the Feasts**

1.  **Redemption (Passover)** --- The Lamb slain.

2.  **Separation (Unleavened Bread)** --- The old life removed.

3.  **Resurrection (Firstfruits)** --- New life begun.

4.  **Empowerment (Pentecost)** --- Spirit poured out.

5.  **Regathering (Trumpets)** --- Saints summoned.

6.  **Reconciliation (Atonement)** --- Israel restored.

7.  **Rejoicing (Tabernacles)** --- God dwelling forever.

These feasts are not random holy days but **a sevenfold panorama of the
Gospel** --- from cross to crown.

**14. Christ the Center of All Appointed Times**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Divine Pattern**     **Leviticus**   **Fulfillment in Christ**
  ---------------------- --------------- ------------------------------------
  "Holy convocations"    23:2            Church, the gathered people of God

  "In their seasons"     23:4            "In the fullness of time" (Gal 4:4)

  "Offerings made by     23:8, 18        The work of the Spirit applying the
  fire"                                  cross

  "Sabbath rest"         23:3            Eternal rest in Christ (Heb 4:9--10)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every feast begins and ends with **rest** --- all divine activity starts
and concludes with Christ's finished work.

**15. Doctrinal Synthesis**

1.  **The Feasts reveal God's redemptive timeline.**\
    From Passover to Tabernacles, the Gospel is prefigured.

2.  **Christ fulfills every feast.**\
    He is the Lamb, the Bread, the Firstfruits, the Lord of the Harvest,
    the Coming King.

3.  **The Spirit continues the work of Pentecost.**\
    The Church lives between the feasts of Pentecost and Trumpets ---
    the harvest interval.

4.  **Israel's story is not finished.**\
    Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles await national and universal
    fulfillment.

5.  **Eternal rest crowns the plan.**\
    The feasts begin with redemption and end with God dwelling among His
    people.

**Closing Meditation**

*"These are the feasts of the LORD... which you shall proclaim to be
holy convocations."* --- Leviticus 23:37

From the first lamb slain in Egypt to the final harvest joy of
Tabernacles, **Christ is the center of God's calendar**. Every trumpet
blast, every loaf of unleavened bread, every booth and every sheaf ---
all speak of Him.

*"In the fullness of time God sent forth His Son."* --- Galatians 4:4\
*"The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."* --- John 1:14

The feasts begin with blood and end with glory --- the same pattern by
which the believer walks: **from redemption to rest, from cross to
crown.**
